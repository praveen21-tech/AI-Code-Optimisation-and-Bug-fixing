# AI-Code-Optimisation-and-Bug-fixing
AI-powered code optimization and security assistant that goes beyond traditional AI code assistants. Unlike existing tools that focus on minor bug fixes and simple refactoring, our solution provides deep structural improvements, adaptive refactoring.

# Key Features:
✅ Real-Time Code Optimization: Our AI model streams optimized code in real time, ensuring efficiency and accuracy.



✅ Multi-Language Support: Supports Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++ for broader usability.



✅ Context-Aware Refactoring: AI understands the structure and logic of code, suggesting improvements that enhance readability, maintainability, and efficiency.



✅ Speech & Multilingual Capabilities: Users can interact with the system using voice input and receive explanations in English, Tamil, and Hindi, along with text-to-speech (TTS) integration for enhanced accessibility.



✅ Adaptive Learning Mechanism: The AI model improves over time, adapting to various coding styles and industry best practices.
